There's a great Lucky Charms sifter up on Thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12772 

But it has one problem: it's only available as an STL file, not in the helpfully open source OpenSCAD format!  Also it didn't fit on my 3D printer and I don't own any STL editing software.

So, I've recreated it here as a present for my little sister.

Serious props to Tom Lombardi for his work in the original design,
which probably took a lot of arduous test runs.
